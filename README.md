# Trading
This repository contains my work on trading strategies, quantitative analysis, and backtesting research. It includes multiple versions of strategies, risk management models, and data-driven insights. Feel free to explore, and if you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out via email.


Disclaimer:
1->The folder "Framework_And_Workflow" contains all my code, including both working and non-working versions. It serves as a reference for the development process that led to the final     
  implementation. Feel free to explore it if you're interested in the workflow behind the final strategy.

2->Pfd's are not viewable in git itself so please download it to view.
