#Overview
The Trading folder contains my personal work on trading strategies, quantitative analysis, and backtesting research. It includes multiple versions of strategies, risk management models, and data-driven insights.

Projects
1. comment_classifier_project
An end-to-end fully automated project that uses AI/ML to perform comment classification on traders' comments across different commodities.

2. data_validation_project
Checks the data from the source and the data within the system to ensure there is no change in contract prices (e.g., DFL, CFD, spread) for Brent.

3. settlement_time_extraction
Extracts data from the source/arbitrator website on non-standard trading days. It provides a dynamic interface for traders to enter a date and retrieve all relevant information regarding product settlement timings and the reason for any changes.

4. Helper Calculators
Tools used during trading to help understand the exposure of planned trades.
